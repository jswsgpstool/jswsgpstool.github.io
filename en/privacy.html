            <p>Last updated: November 24, 2025</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to GPS Tool ("we," "our," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect information that is necessary to provide and improve our service. The types of information we collect are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> To provide the core satellite signal analysis functionality, the App requires access to your device's precise location information. This data is processed locally on your device solely for calculating and displaying satellite data. We do not store, transmit, or share your historical or real-time location information with any third party.</li>
                <li><strong>NMEA Data:</strong> The App processes raw NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) data streams from your device's GPS hardware. This data includes technical information such as satellite PRN, signal strength, and azimuth, which is essential for the satellite visualization and analysis features. All NMEA data is processed locally and is not uploaded to our servers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the features of our App.</li>
                <li>To analyze satellite signals and present them to you intuitively through charts and lists.</li>
                <li>To improve the user experience and functionality of the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
            <p>We solemnly swear that we will not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer any of your personal information (including location and NMEA data) to outside parties. All data processing is performed locally on your device.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all sensitive data is stored on your local device and is not transmitted, the risks associated with data breaches are minimized. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security of the application data on your device.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page or through in-app notifications.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
